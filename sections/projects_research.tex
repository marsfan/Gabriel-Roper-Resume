\PositionY{Avionics Integration Testbench Software}{}{2025}{Present}
{
    Developed software for system to read in flight parameters from flight simulator
    and then transmit data over ARINC429 to flight hardware under test
}

\PositionY{Display Platform Verification}{}{2025}{2025}
{Developed and executed verification tests tests for DAL-A primary flight display hardware support libraries}

\PositionY{SCADE Based Engine Display}{}{2023}{2025}
{
    Developed various primary flight displays and engine displays for existing hardware
    using ANSYS SCADE.
}

\PositionY{Standalone Flight Hardware Emulator}{}{2022}{2024}
{
    Designed, implemented, and maintained system for emulating under-development
    data concentrator hardware on a standalone x86 PC that communicates with software
    developer's computers to allow for rapid testing of software without requiring usage
    of actual target hardware
}

\PositionY{Data Concentrator Cockpit Interface}{}{2021}{2024}
{
    Developed menu interface for commercial aircraft data concentrator
    that consists of interactive pages on an ARINC 739A MCDU.
}

\PositionY{Dynamic and Kinematic Quadrupedal Robot Motion Planning}{}{2020}{2021}
{
    Designed, built, and tested a quadraped walking robot that
    is capable of fully automatic leg motion planning, as well as autonomous mapping and navigation.
